What happens when you provide negative arguments to str.slice()?; When given negative numbers as the indices, str.slice() treats them as string length + index.; js101
slice and substring differences; 1. When the start index is greater than the end index, substring swaps the two arguments while slice returns an empty string. 2. When either argument is negative, substring treats them as 0, while, as we saw above, slice treats them as length + index. We recommend using String.prototype.slice. Its behavior is more natural and predictable when dealing with these edge cases.; js101
What happens when an object is initialized with duplicate key/property names?; The first one is overwritten by the next one.; js101
How to differentiate between a non-existent property vs. a property that has undefined as its value?; 1. Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty, 2. Object.keys along with the array includes method; js101
How are non-element properties handled with arrays?; 1. length property does not change, 2. these properties are ignored by array methods like forEach, map, and filter, 3. these properties are included by object methods like Object.keys; js101
