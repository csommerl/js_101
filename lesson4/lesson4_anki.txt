What happens when you provide negative arguments to str.slice()?; When given negative numbers as the indices, str.slice() treats them as string length + index.; js101
slice and substring differences; 1. When the start index is greater than the end index, substring swaps the two arguments while slice returns an empty string. 2. When either argument is negative, substring treats them as 0, while, as we saw above, slice treats them as length + index. We recommend using String.prototype.slice. Its behavior is more natural and predictable when dealing with these edge cases.; js101
What happens when an object is initialized with duplicate key/property names?; The first one is overwritten by the next one.; js101
How to differentiate between a non-existent property vs. a property that has undefined as its value?; 1. Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty, 2. Object.keys along with the array includes method; js101
How are non-element properties handled with arrays?; 1. length property does not change, 2. these properties are ignored by array methods like forEach, map, and filter, 3. these properties are included by object methods like Object.keys; js101
What happens when you try to reassign a string element?string element reassignment, even though it's syntactically permitted, doesn't affect the string. The reassignment value is returned; js101
Difference between str.charAt() and str.[]; when using indices for characters that don't exist, charAt returns an empty string (''), while [] returns undefined; js101
String.prototype.charCodeAt(); method that returns the Unicode code point or character code of the character at that index. A Unicode code point is the number that represents a given character at the machine level. If you don't provide an index, it assumes the index 0.; js101
What it means to be a static method?; It is a method that operates directly on the class/constructor for the particular data type; js101
String.prototype.trimEnd(); method that removes whitespace from the end of a string. trimRight() is an alias of this method.; js101
String.prototype.startsWith(); mehtod determines whether a string begins with the characters of a specified string, returning true or false as appropriate.; js101
