# Lesson 1: Preparations

## Welcome
- Use Gist or Pastebin to share code snippets

## Set Up Your Profile Image

## Using Markdown
- [Github Flavored Markdown Spec](https://github.github.com/gfm/)

## Finish Prep Course

## System Check
- `node -v`

## Differences Between JavaScript Versions
- arity: (logic) the number of arguments that a function can take; js101

## Git and Github
- public repositories?

## Active Learning

## Good vs Bad Questions
- Bad questions include:
  - those that are easily testable
- Good questions include:
  - asking why?

- Why does passing a variable as an argument to a function not change that variable?
  - Because the variable within the function shadows the original variable: a new, separate, independent variable is created with the same name, and this new shadow variable's scope is limited to the function.

## Lesson Discussion Forums
Take the time to read all of the pinned threads in the discussion forum for each lesson.

- https://repl.it/

## Exercises: Small Problems
You should try to do around 20 exercises (or 2 sets) after each lesson.

### [PEDAC](https://medium.com/launch-school/solving-coding-problems-with-pedac-29141331f93f)

PEDAC stands for:
  1. Understand the Problem
  2. Write Examples/Test Cases
  3. Data Structure
  4. Algorithm
  5. Code

#### PEDAC
| Objective | Step | Description|
| :--- | :---  | :-----      |
| Process the Problem | Understand the Problem | <ul><li>Identify expected input and output</li><li>Make the requirements explicit</li><li>Identify rules</li><li>Mental model of the problem (optional)</li></ul> |
| | Examples/Test Case | Validate understanding of the problem |
| | Data Structure | How we represent data that we will work with when converting the input to output. |
| | Algorithm | Steps for converting input to output |
| Code with Intent | Code | Implementation of Algorithm |
