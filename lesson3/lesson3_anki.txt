what happens when an array indices are skipped and an item is added to the array; skipped array indices are empty (different from simply undefined) but will return undefined when accessed, they'll be skipped (e.g., map); js101
String.prototype.endsWith(); method that determines whether a string ends with the characters of a specified string, returning true or false as appropriate; js101
String.prototype.charAt(); method that returns a new string consisting of the single UTF-16 code unit located at the specified offset into the string.; js101
false == '0' evaluates to?; when a non-empty string evaluates to true; js101
Ways to tell if str1 includes str2; 1. str1.includes(str2), 2. str1.match(str2) !== null, 3. str1.indexOf(str2) > -1, 4. /str2/.test(str1); js101
Ways to add a value to an array: 1. arr.push(value) // (returns new length of array), 2. arr[arr.length] = value // (returns value), 3. arr = arr.concat(value) // (returns new array); js101
How to add multiple items to an array; arr.push(item1, item2); js101
How to get a part of str1 before str2?; str1.slice(0, str1.indexOf(str2)); js101
how to replace first instance of strPart1 of str with strPart2?; str.replace(strPart1, strPart2); js101
how to replace all instances of strPart1 of str with strPart2?; str.replace(/strPart1/g, strPart2); js101
how to use spread syntax to create a new array from invoking a mutating method on an original array, without changing the original array; let newArr = [...originalArr].mutatingMethod(); js101
how to use slice to create a new array from invoking a mutating method on an original array, without changing the original array; let newArr = originalArr.slice().mutatingMethod; js101
what happens when Array.prototype.sort's compareFunction(a, b) returns value > 0; b is sorted before a; js101
what happens when Array.prototype.sort's compareFunction(a, b) returns value < 0; a is sorted before b; js101
what happens when Array.prototype.sort's compareFunction(a, b) returns value === 0; keeps original order of a and b; js101
How to delete an element in an array at a particular index?; Use Array.prototype.splice(idx, 1); js101
How to add an element in an array at a particular index?; Use Array.prototype.splice(idx, 0, elem); js101
What is the result of [].concat(1, [2, 3]); If concat is given multiple argument, then it unnests any arrays within those arguments: so the result is [1, 2, 3]; js101
How to get only the values of an array, regardless of whether they are nested?; newArr = [].concat(...originalArr); js101
Array.prototype.flat(); method that creates a new array with all sub-array elements concatenated into it recursively up to the specified depth; js101
Array.prototype.every(); method that tests whether all elements in the array pass the test implemented by the provided function. It returns a Boolean value; js101
String.prototype.endsWith(); method that determines whether a string ends with the characters of a specified string, returning true or false as appropriate; js101
String.prototype.padStart(targetLength, padString); method that pads the current string with another string (multiple times, if needed) until the resulting string reaches the given length. The padding is applied from the start of the current string: default padString is ' '; js101
What happens when you use + with arrays as operands?; JavaScript doesn't let you concatenate arrays with +. Instead, the + operator first converts the arrays to strings, and then concatenates the strings; js101
deep copy of an array or object; makes a duplicate of every item in an existing array or object. In particular, it creates completely new instances of any subarrays or subobjects in the source object.; js101
shallow copy of an array or object; only makes a duplicate of the outermost values in an array or object, i.e., any elements that are themselves arrays or objects will be the same arrays/objects; js101
Output of NaN === NaN; The output is false. NaN is a special numeric value that indicates that an operation that was intended to return a number failed. Use Number.isNaN() instead; js101
