In real code, you wouldn't usually use the true or false values directly in a conditional expression like value === true.

Use case for short-circuit evaluation:
- use a conjunction to test whether something exists && test whether it is not null

Important distinction:
  - returns true or false
  - returns a truthy value or falsy value === evaluates to true or evaluates to false
